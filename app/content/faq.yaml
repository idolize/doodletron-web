  - question: What is Doodletron AI?
    answer: |
      Doodletron AI is an innovative app that transforms children's drawings into amazing, detailed artwork using artificial intelligence. Simply take a photo of your child's sketch, and watch it come to life with enhanced details, colors, and artistic flair.

      The app is designed to encourage creativity and imagination in kids while providing parents with a fun way to preserve and enhance their children's artwork.
  - question: How does the AI transformation work?
    answer: |
      Our AI analyzes your child's drawing and understands the shapes, objects, and artistic intent. It then enhances the artwork by:

      - **Adding realistic details** to simple shapes
      - **Applying appropriate colors** and shading
      - **Improving proportions** and artistic composition
      - **Maintaining the original creative vision** while making it more polished

      The process typically takes less than a minute, and you'll see your child's simple sketch transformed into a professional-looking piece of art.
  - question: Is Doodletron AI safe for children?
    answer: |
      Absolutely! Doodletron AI is designed with children's safety and privacy in mind:

      - **No personal data collection** - we don't store or share your child's photos or other information
      - **No social features** - the app focuses purely on creativity and fun; you only see your own generated artwork
      - **No ads** - no third-party advertising

      We're committed to providing a safe, educational, and entertaining experience for families.
  - question: What devices is Doodletron AI available on?
    answer: |
      Doodletron AI is currently available for **iOS devices** through TestFlight beta testing. We're working on expanding to additional platforms.

      **System Requirements:**
      - iOS 17.6 or later
      - iPhone or iPad
      - Internet connection for AI processing
  - question: Can I save and share the transformed artwork?
    answer: |
      Yes! All your generated masterpieces are saved on your device in the "Gallery" tab. You can also easily save and share your child's AI-enhanced artwork outside of the app:

      - **Save to Photos** - transformed artwork can be saved to your device's photo library
      - **Share with family** - send the enhanced artwork to grandparents, friends, and family
  - question: What if the AI doesn't understand my child's drawing?
    answer: |
      Our AI is designed to be very flexible and can handle a wide variety of drawings, from simple stick figures to more complex scenes. However, if the transformation doesn't turn out as expected:

      - **Try different angles** - sometimes a slightly different photo angle helps
      - **Ensure good lighting** - clear, well-lit photos work best
      - **Rotate the photo** - sometimes a slightly different photo angle helps

      Remember, part of the fun is seeing how the AI interprets your child's unique artistic style!
