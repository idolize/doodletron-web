## 1. Introduction

Doodletron AI, Inc. (“Doodletron,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) provides mobile and web applications that transform children’s drawings and photos into AI-enhanced artwork, private galleries, and related features (“Service”). We take privacy seriously, especially regarding children and families. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the information you share with us. This Privacy Policy applies to Doodletron AI, Inc. websites, mobile apps, and related services (“Service”) and describes how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard personal information when you interact with Doodletron (collectively, the “Services”). By using the Service, you agree with Doodletron’s collection, use, and sharing of your personal information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use.

## 2. Scope and Audience

This Policy applies to all visitors and any other individuals (“users” or “you”) who access or use DoodleTron’s mobile apps, website, in-app features, customer support, and any related services (“Service”).

## 3. Information We Collect

Information we collect falls into one of two categories: “voluntarily provided” information and “automatically collected” information.

“Voluntarily provided” information refers to any information you knowingly and actively provide us when using our app and its associated services.

“Automatically collected” information refers to any information automatically sent by your device in the course of accessing our app and
its associated services.

### Log Data

When you access our servers via our app, we may automatically log the standard data provided by your device. It may include your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your device type and version, your
activity within the app, time and date, and other details about your
usage.

Additionally, when you encounter certain errors while using the app, we automatically collect data about the error and the circumstances surrounding its occurrence. This data may include technical details about your device, what you were trying to do when the error happened,
and other technical information relating to the problem. You may or may not receive notice of such errors, even in the moment they occur, that they have occurred, or what the nature of the error is.

Please be aware that while this information may not be personally identifying by itself, it may be possible to combine it with other data to personally identify individual persons.

### Personal Information

We may ask for personal information — for example, when you submit content to us or when you contact us — which may include one or more of the following:

- Name
- Email
- Social media profiles

### User-Generated Content

We consider “user-generated content” to be materials (text, image and/or video content) voluntarily supplied to us by our users for the purpose of publication on our platform or website. All user-generated content is associated with the account or email address used to submit the materials.

Your “user-generated content” is entirely private and available only on your device to you.

### Legitimate Reasons for Processing Your Personal Information

We only collect and use your personal information when we have a legitimate reason for doing so. In which instance, we only collect personal information that is reasonably necessary to provide our services to you.

## 4. Settings, Privacy by Default & Data Security

- All Doodletron galleries are private by default; content is never publicly visible or shared unless a parent decides to share any user-generated content.
- No discoverability, social sharing, location, or communication features exist within the Doodletron.

## 5. How We Use Information

- Deliver services: process, store, and display artwork and user-generated content.
- Account management: billing and subscriptions (via secure payment processors), feature access.
- Safety and security: prevent unauthorized access, fraud, or misuse and to enforce our Terms of Service.
- Analytics and improvement: performance, debugging, anonymous and aggregated research only.
- Communication: Transactional notices, response to inquiries, newsletters, product updates, contests, or offers are sent to Doodletron accounts only, with simple opt-out at any time.

We may combine voluntarily provided and automatically collected personal information with general information or research data we receive from other trusted sources.

When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.

Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data security.

You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security strength, ensuring the security of your own information within the bounds of our services. For example, ensuring any passwords associated with accessing your personal information and accounts are secure and confidential.

## 6. Data Retention & Deletion

- Data is retained only as long as needed for the purposes collected and never indefinitely.
- Retention periods are specified in our written policy and can be provided upon
  request. When accounts are deleted or consents withdrawn, all personal
  information and user content are wiped from active systems, and removal
  is requested from any processors.

## 7. Sharing and Disclosure

We never sell users' personal information. Limited disclosure occurs only:

- To service providers (cloud/storage, analytics, billing, support, device/app performance analytics), strictly under contract limiting use to service provision only.
- With explicit, opt-in consent (e.g., when sharing content externally, exporting files, or printing).
- For legal obligations: court order, law enforcement request, or mandatory reporting.
- To Apple for refund requests: we may share basic consumption information (such as how long you have used the app, how frequently you access it, and other usage patterns) with Apple, only in the case of reviewing and processing App Store refund requests.
- During business transfers (e.g., merger, acquisition): users are notified and existing privacy commitments honored.
- Aggregated, anonymized data for performance metrics, never identifying individuals.
- No model training or data sharing with third parties unless a user opts in for specific, defined uses, and only using de-identified data where possible.

# 8. Cookies and Similar Technologies

We use:

- Essential cookies – necessary for authentication, security, and core site features.
- Analytics cookies – help us understand usage patterns and improve performance.
- Marketing cookies – enable interest‑based advertising (set only with consent where required). You may disable cookies in your browser; however, some features may not function properly.

# 9. International Data Transfers

We operate in the United States. Where local law requires, we rely on mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses, adequacy decisions, or your explicit consent to lawfully transfer personal data across borders.

## 10. Parental Responsibility & Child Data

Doodletron is intended for use by parents and guardians to engage with their children’s artwork.

We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children under 13.

Any images or drawings of children or created by children must be uploaded and managed by a parent or guardian.

If we become aware that personal information has been collected from a child without verified parental consent, we will delete it promptly.

Parents or guardians are responsible for supervising use of the app and ensuring that any content shared complies with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

# 11. Changes to This Policy

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time at our sole discretion. We will notify you about material changes in the way we treat personal data by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account and/or by placing a prominent notice on our website. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically. When we do change the Privacy Policy, we will also revise the "Last Updated" date. 1
